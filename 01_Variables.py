# Assignment 
# of 
# variables

#1. variable = value

#2. no need to write the data type in python because of dynamically-typed feature

# number = 10 #defining a variable
# print(number)
# print("This is a number", number)
# print("This is a number" + " The value is 10")
# print(number + number)
# print("This is not a number" * number)

#1. wap to define 2 numbers and add them

# num1, num2 = 20, 30
# num3 = num1 + num2
# print(num3)

#2. wap to define 2 numbers and perform addition, subtraction, multiplicaton and division

#multiple assignments in 1 line

# store 3 values in 3 variables
# num1,num2,num3 = 1, 2, 3
# print(num1, num3)

# #3. define 5 nums but store and print only the first and last

# num1, _, _, _, num5 = 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 #throwaway variable _
# print(num1, num5)
