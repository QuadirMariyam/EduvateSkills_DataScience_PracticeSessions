# #num1 + num2 - num3, operator = +, operands = num1, num2

# #Python = 5 types of Operators 
# #1 - Arithmetic Operator +, -, *, /, %(modulus), //, **

# n1 = 10
# n2 = 2

# print("Addition ", n1 + n2)
# print("Subtraction",n1 - n2)
# print("multiplication", n1 * n2)
# print("Division (output in float)", n1 / n2) # int - -1, 0, 1, float 3.4, -6.77
# print("Floor Division (output in integer)", n1 // n2)
# print("Modulus", n1 % n2)
# print("Exponents/ Power",n1 ** n2)

# #1. storage/ memory limits of data types in python - int, float, string

# 2 - Comparison/ Relational Operator (Judge)

# n1 = 10
# n2 = 20

# compare = n1 == n2 #equal to operator
# print("==",compare)
# compare = n1 <= n2 #less than equal to operator
# print("<=",compare)
# compare = n1 < n2 # less than operator
# print("<",compare)
# compare = n1 >= n2 # greater than equal to operator
# print(">=",compare)
# compare = n1 > n2 # greater than operator
# print(">",compare)
# compare = n1 != n2 # not equals to operator
# print("!=",compare)


# print(n1)
# print(n2)

#3 - Logical Operators

# n1 = 10
# n2 = 20

# logic = (n1>=n2) and (n1!=n2) # and operator, ex- marriage, 1 - False and True, - False
# print(logic)
# logic = (n1>=n2) or (n1!=n2) # or operator
# print(logic)
# logic = not (n1!=n2) # not operator
# print(logic)

#4 - Assignment Operator

# a = 10
# b = 20

# a += 1 # add 1 and assign
# b -= 2 # subtract by 2 and then assign the value to 'b'
# a *= 3
# a /= 2
# a //= 3
# b %= 2
# b **= 10

# wap to swap 2 numbers, a = 2, b = 3 >>> a = 3, b = 2
# wap to take an even nos, and print True or False
#wap to take 2 digit number and print its digits with a comma, ex - 45 >>> 4, 5

# even = any number that is divisible by 2 = / 2 = 0
# num = 11
# print(num % 2 == 0)

# 45 =  4, 5
# number = 27
# n2 = number // 10
# digit = number % 10
# print(n2)
# print(digit)

# mini- assignment 1. find out a number is even without using modulo operator, 2. 3 digit - ex, 405 = 4, 0, 5,

# Bitwise Operator - binary conversion 17 - 10001

# # & = 5 & 3 = 0101 & 0011 = 0001 = 1 and operation and table
# print(5 & 3)
# # | = 5 | 3 = 0101 | 0011 = 0111 = 7 or operation and table
# print(5 | 3)
# # ^ = 5 | 3 = 0101 | 0011 = 0110 = 6 XOR operation and table
# print(5 ^ 3)
# # ~ = ~5 = ~0101 = 1010 NOT (2s Complement) #signed, unsigned
# print(~5)
# # << Left shift = 5<<3 = 00000101 << 0011 = 00110101 = 40
# print(5<<3)
# # >> Right shift = 5>>3 = 0
# print(5>>3)


# print(10/3)

#Identity Operators (mirror)

# print(45 is 45) # ==

# print(32 is not 32)

#membership operator
# s = 'apple'
# print('a' in 'orange')
# print('apple' is s)

# print(32 not in 32)

#difference between 'is' from identity operator and '==' from logical operator
