# print 1 to 1000

# print(1)

# print(4)
# print(5)

# Loops - 
# 1. repeatative tasks can be done using Loops until the condition is met, 
# 2. loops should be finite - best practice
# 3. loops hs 3 parts - initialization, last, step/ condition
# 4. step - wise loops - for
# 5. condition - wise loops - while 
# types of loops in python - for loop, while loop
# you can use else with loops

# print(range(2, 10, 2))
# for n in range(2, 10, 3):
#     print(n)
# else:
#     print("Thanks")

# i = 2
# while( i < 10):
#     print(i)
#     i += 3
# else:
#     print("Thanks")
#     print(i)
# print(i)

# print 1 to 50 using while
# make a game using loop in which you keep asking number from a user until the user gives input as 0
# print multiplication table from 2 to 5
# loop 1 to 30, for multiple of 3, print("6, Fizz"), multiple of 5, print("5, Buzz"), multiple of both 3 and 5, print(number, "FizzBuzz")

# nested for loop

# for n in range(1, 6, 1):
#     print(f"Table of {n}")
#     for i in range(1, 11, 1):
#         print(f"{n} x {i} = {n*i}")
#     print("-----")
